Flexbox:

1. Flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either as rows or columns.
2. It's excellent for aligning and distributing items within a container along a single axis.
3. Best suited for creating responsive designs and aligning items within a single row or column, such as navigation menus or centering content vertically and horizontally.
4. It's not well-suited for complex two-dimensional layouts.

CSS Grid:

1. CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, enabling both rows and columns to be defined.
2. It's great for creating grid-based designs, like those found in web page layouts with rows and columns.
3. Allows precise control over the placement and sizing of items within the grid, making it ideal for complex, grid-based designs.
4. While it can also be used for simpler one-dimensional layouts, it offers more power and flexibility than Flexbox for such cases.

When to choose one over the other:

1. Use Flexbox when you need to control the layout along one axis (either rows or columns) and when dealing with simpler, single-axis layouts.
2. Choose CSS Grid when you require a grid-based layout with precise control over both rows and columns, or for more complex, two-dimensional layouts.

In practice, it's common to use both Flexbox and CSS Grid together in a single project, as they complement each other. Flexbox is often used to align items within grid cells or to control the layout of smaller components within a grid-based design. The choice between them depends on the specific layout requirements of project.
