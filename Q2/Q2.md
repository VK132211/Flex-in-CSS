1. Justify-content:

   - `justify-content` is a CSS property used in Flexbox layouts to control the alignment and distribution of items along the main axis (either horizontally or vertically). It allows you to specify how items are positioned within a container. Some common values for `justify-content` include:
     - `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the container.
     - `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the container.
     - `center`: Items are centered within the container.
     - `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with space between them.
     - `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with space around them.

2. Align-items:

   - `align-items` is used to control the alignment of items along the cross axis (the axis perpendicular to the main axis) in a Flexbox container. Common values include:
     - `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the start of the cross axis.
     - `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.
     - `center`: Items are centered on the cross axis.
     - `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the entire cross-axis dimension.

3. Gap:

   - `gap` property defines the amount of space between the rows and columns of a flex container. The gap is a shorthand property for defining the row-gap and column-gap.

4. Flex-direction:

   - `flex-direction` is used to determine the main axis and the direction in which Flexbox items are laid out. It can have values like:
     - `row`: Items are laid out horizontally (default).
     - `row-reverse`: Items are laid out horizontally in reverse order.
     - `column`: Items are laid out vertically.
     - `column-reverse`: Items are laid out vertically in reverse order.

5. Flex-wrap:
   - `flex-wrap` is a property that controls whether Flexbox items should wrap onto new lines when they don't fit within the container. Values include:
     - `nowrap` (default): Items are not allowed to wrap and will overflow the container if necessary.
     - `wrap`: Items will wrap onto new lines if needed to fit within the container.
     - `wrap-reverse`: Items will wrap onto new lines in the reverse order.
